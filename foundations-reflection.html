            What surprised me the most about the Human Skills learning is...
          </h1>
          <p class="normalText">I was suprised by how much eastern philosisophy is ingraved into the problem solving manteras widely known in the programming world. "thinking like a programmer" for examples draws a lot from buddaism and it was intresting to see that infulence as that is something I have been aware of and sometimes practise. It was also intresting to see how much the problem solving abilites corrrelate to real world situatitons.</p>

            What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?
          </h2>
          <p class="normalText">
            <li class="lightText">1. Became aware of the two main states I learn in; either feeling like I know everything and I am fine, or that I know nothing and I'm so behind </li>
            <li class="lightText">2. I more closely monitor my negative thoughts and I am quicker to recontextulise bad thoughts into thoughts that are useful.</li>
            <li class="lightText">3. Nice to know that I had a good understanding of the helpful practises taught in the human skills curiculam. Means I can dive even deeper during bootcamp</li>              
          </p>           
          <h2 class="subtitle">
            What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
          </h2>
          <p class="normalText">
            Having strong values helps you keep convinction during the hard moments. Empathy helps you relate to people easier and when people get along it makes communication easier. Self-awareness helps you monitor your feelings better and not step on anyones toes when pairings/working in a team.

            What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?
          </h2>
          <p class="normalText">
            Just suprised about where the philosisophy of programming draws from.
          </p>
          <h2 class="subtitle">
            What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
          </h2>
          <p class="normalText">
            Reading about bad habits then relating to them. 
          </p>
          <h2 class="subtitle">
            Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
          </h2>
          <p class="normalText">
            Anyone can learn the languages and code but not everyone is a well rounded person able to communicate with people in a meaningful way.
          </p>
          <h2 class="subtitle">
            Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
          </h2>
          <p class="normalText">
            Not a waste of time persay but I already knew a lot of the content before hand (read a lot of pych/philosisophy books and spend time discussing the topics with friends). I understand the importance of treating human skills equally to the technical side. I just wish there was some stretch content for it.
