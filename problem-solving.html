            Blocked on a simple problem

            I couldn't get my local host to work and how I solved this problem was googling it then systmactically went through the potential problems one by one. I got very annoyed at myself for not being able to figure it out. During the process I did figure out about how to access my firewalls and learning more about how they opperate. If i were to go back I would've asked for help. It was an easy fix, just with my knowledge it was hard.

            I learnt how to use a for loop for mathmatics in a previous sprint but I wanted to try solve it without looking at my notes. I got my gridded math book out and drew a flow chart without syntax to get an idea of all of the steps I thought needed to happen. This gave me a good overview of what needed to happoen as well the holes in my knowledge.
            I felt good throughout the process because of my curious mindset going into the problem. I didn't learn anything technically new but I did experience how much better solving a problem feels when you have more objective about not knowing.

              I am not easily detered when trying to crack problems. I don't mind going through most to least likely, or finding a starting position and trying to connect the dots.

             Pretty good at this. Copy and paste into google. Or try to remeber if I have seen it before and write down what i think It is before googling it.

            I am still reluctant to ask for help. Stems from a fear of not being able to pay attention. Used to figuring problems by myself. Bad habits that need to be broken
