          <li class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light my-2">
            I googled the problem then systmactically went through the potential problems one by one.

          <li class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light my-2">
            I was annoyed and felt stupid for not being able to figure it out.
          </li>
          <li class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light">
            I learnt how to access my firewalll settings and learn more about local hosts. Then also learnt that trying to solve problems while angry isn't great.

          <li class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light my-2">
            I learnt how to use a for loop for mathmatics in a previous sprint but I wanted to try solve it without looking at my notes. I got my gridded math book out and drew a flow chart without syntax to get an idea of all of the steps I thought needed to happen. This gave me a good overview of what needed to happoen as well the holes in my knowledge.
          </li>
          <li class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light my-2">
            I felt good throughout the process because of my curious mindset going into the problem.

          <li class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light my-2">
            I didn't learn anything technically new but I did experience how much better solving a problem feels when you have more objective about not knowing.

            I am still reluctant to ask for help. Stems from a fear of not being able to pay attention. Used to figuring problems by myself. Bad habits that need to be broken
