    <h1>Classes vs. Ids</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Both are tags that help target page elements and are fundamental building
      blocks for: css, html and javascript.
    </p>
    <h2>Differnces</h2>
    <p>
      The main difference between both of them is that ids are unique and
      classes are not.
    </p>
    <h2>So what does that mean?</h2>
    <em>For Classses</em>
    <p>
      You can use the same class on multiple elements and you can use multiple
      elements on the same classes.
    </p>
    <em>For Ids</em>
    <p>
      You can use one ID for each element and each page can only have that one
      element with that Id once.
    </p>
    <h2>So what are the best ways to use both?</h2>
    <em>For Classes</em>
    <p>
      Since classes cam be used by multiple elements on the same page and
      multiple classes can be used by a single element on the same page, an
      example of best practices is with styling or any other broad targeting
      tasks. Instead of needing to make a new Id for every element you want to
      target you can use classes to speed up the process. Its resusability is it
      strength.
    </p>
    <em>For Ids</em>
    <p>
      Since Id's are unique to the element it is applied to, an example of its
      best practice is with '#' value or any other specific targeting. By using
      the '#' in a URL, a browser will locate the specfic element with that
      exact '#' value and automatically scroll. It's uniqueness is its strength.
    </p>
    <h2>Specficity Weight</h2>
    <p>
      Specficity weight is the rule that css uses when deciding what declaration
      to use. Typically the last declaration found when reading the code from
      top to bottom, also known as 'heirachichy', is what will be used if the
      specficity weight is equal. If however the specficity weight is not equal
      then the more specfic declartion will be used not matter what declartion
      was last found.
    </p>
    <p>
      An analogy I found useful for Classes and Ids is serial codes and
      barcodes. A barcode for an iphone product will read the same price at a
      checkout, but both phones have a serial number specfically created for
      itself.
