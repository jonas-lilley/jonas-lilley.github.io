    <h1>Blog 3 - My Learning Plan</h1>
    <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
    <p>
      Before I anwser this question I think it would be helpful to define what a
      long term goal is for me. It exists 5 years in the future and encapsualtes
      my ideal life, not just carrer. With the ongoing development of ai and its
      inevivitable impact on how society opperates I am aiming to be in a
      position to take advantage of its forward directory before the ship sails
      for good. After completing the devacademy course and getting experience of
      working as a junior fullstack developer I would like to transition to
      working primairily on backend development. Then from there, evaluate an
      area of backend development that I overlaps with my intrests and has some
      scarcity. Grow my proficiency in python and other backend languages then
      try to transition into an AI/ML role.

    <h2>Strengths</h2>
    <h3>Fast learner</h3>
    <p>
      Fortunately my adhd gives me some super powers when it comes to being able
      to process infomation really fast and developing my own systems to retain
      information quickly.
    </p>
    <h3>Communication</h3>
    <p>
      I always try best to treat those around me the way I want to be treated.
      This gives me an honest and friendly communication style.
    </p>
    <h3>Enthusiastic</h3>
    <p>
      I love learning and the rush of a subject or concept finally clicking/
      understanding growing. This enthusiasism has created a hard work ethic.
    </p>
    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <h3>Fear of faliure</h3>
    <p>
      I sometimes find it hard to start a project even if I really want to do it
      because I am scared I am not going to live up to my own expectations.
    </p>
    <h3>Prideful</h3>
    <p>
      I have a bad habit of taking to long to ask for help and trying to solve
      all my problems by myself. Thinking that I need to shoulder all of my
      burdens on my own.
    </p>
    <h3>Dishonest</h3>
    <p>
      I am never dishonest with others but sometimes I can be dishonest with
      myself. This leads to giving myself a false sense of security and deluding
      myself on how things are going.
    </p>
    <h2>What skills I would like to develop at Devacademy</h2>
    <p>
      Allowing myself to fail more instead of protecting my ego. I would also
      like to make a more active effort to build genuine connection with my
      peers.
    </p>
    <h2>How I will manage my workload</h2>
    <p>
      How I will manage myself and my workload can be broken down into three
      seperate systems to keep me happy and on track.
    </p>
    <h3>Exercise</h3>
    <p>
      Currently I have a peronal self-imposed non-negotionable routine of
      running and gym workouts. This helps me manage my anxieties and providies
      me with a space to see my problems from a different place.
    </p>
    <h3>Planning</h3>
    <p>
      I have: a daily journal, a daily planning sheet, a whiteboard and a
      phyical calender. All of these tools I use to schudule time to work on
      specific things in advance so I don't have to think about what i am doing
      at what time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every night I review what I have planned for next day and either leave it
      or change it depending on how the day went. I also have Sunday Morning as
      my time during the week to lay the planning ground work.
    </p>
    <h3>Support</h3>
    <p>
      Firstly I have my parents to rely on for emotional support if I feel
      overwhelmed. Then I have a close group of friends that I make to time to
      catch up with every week; whether its going for a beer or going for a
      hike.
    </p>
    <h2>How I will ask for help</h2>
    <p>
      In foundations I will reach out via discord if I am struggling with course
      content. A message which is descriptive of the problem that I am facing
      with an attached photo of the problem. Either posted directly to my
      facilitator, foundations-helpdesk or my homegroup.
    </p>
    <h2>What I expect of the Facilitation team</h2>
    <p>
      To be a respectful and helpful guiding hand to assist with anything I dont
      understand or have trouble with. To point me in the right direction, not
      lead me the whole way.
    </p>
    <h2>Scheduling information</h2>
    <p>
      I have basketball every Wednesday night, but during the tailend of
      bootcamp I already discussed the fact that I might miss a couple of games
      during that time
