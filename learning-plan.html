            What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
          </h2>
          <p class="normalText">
            Before I anwser this question I think it would be helpful to define
          what a long term goal is for me. It exists 5 years in the future and
          encapsualtes my ideal life, not just carrer. With the ongoing
          development of ai and its inevivitable impact on how society opperates
          I am aiming to be in a position to take advantage of its forward
          directory before the ship sails for good.
          </p>
          <p class="normalText">
            After completing the devacademy course and getting experience of
          working as a junior fullstack developer I would like to transition to
          working primairily on backend development. Then from there, evaluate
          an area of backend development that I overlaps with my intrests and
          has some scarcity. Grow my proficiency in python and other backend
          languages then try to transition into an AI/ML role.

            What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
          </h2>

            Strengths
          </h2>
          <li class="normalText">Fast learner
          </li>
            <p class="lightText">Fortunately my adhd gives me some super powers when it comes to being
            able to process infomation really fast and developing my own systems
            to retain information quickly.
            </p>
          <li class="normalText">Communication
          </li>
            <p class="lightText">I always try best to treat those around me the way I want to be
              treated. This gives me an honest and friendly communication style.
            </p>
          <li class="normalText">Enthusiastic
          </li>
          <p class="lightText"> I love learning and the rush of a subject or concept finally clicking/
            understanding growing. This enthusiasism has created a hard work
            ethic.
          </p>
          <h3 class="subtitle">
            Weaknesses
          </h3>
          <li class="normalText">
            Fear of faliure
          </li>
          <p class="lightText">
            I sometimes find it hard to start a project even if I really want to
            do it because I am scared I am not going to live up to my own
            expectations.
          </p>
          <li class="normalText">
            Prideful
          </li>
          <p class="lightText">
            I have a bad habit of taking to long to ask for help and trying to
            solve all my problems by myself. Thinking that I need to shoulder all
            of my burdens on my own.
          </p>
          <li class="normalText">
            Dishonest
          </li>
          <p class="lightText">
            I am never dishonest with others but sometimes I can be dishonest with myself. This leads to giving myself a false sense of security and deluding myself on how things are going.
          </p>
          <h2 class="subtitle">
            What skills do I want to develop at dev?
          </h2>
          <li class="normalText">To fail better</li>
          <p class="lightText">Allowing myself to fail more instead of protecting my ego</p>
          <li class="normalText">To connect better</li>
          <p class="lightText">
            Make a more active effort to build genuine connection
            with my peers.
          </p>
          <h2 class="subtitle">
            How will I manage my workload?
          </h2>
          <li class="normalText">Non-negtionables</li>
          <p class="lightText">
            Currently I have a peronal self-imposed Non-negotionables routine of
            running and gym workouts. This helps me manage my anxieties and
            providies me with a space to see my problems from a different place.</p>
          <li class="normalText">Schuduling systems</li>
          <p class="lightText">  
            I have: a daily journal, a daily planning sheet, a whiteboard and a
            phyical calender. All of these tools I use to schudule time to work on
            specific things in advance so I don't have to think about what i am
            doing at what time.</p>
          <li class="normalText">
            Planning</li>
          <p class="lightText"> 
           Every night I review what I have planned for next day and either
          leave it or change it depending on how the day went. I also have
          Sunday Morning as my time during the week to lay the planning ground
          work.
          </p>
          <h2 class="subtitle">
            What support do I have?
          </h2>
          <li class="normalText">Famiy</li>
          <p class="lightText">
            I have my parents to rely on for emotional support if I feel
            overwhelmed.
          </p>
          <li class="normalText">Friends</li>
          <p class="lightText">
            I have a close group of friends that I make to time
            to catch up with every week; whether its going for a beer or going for
            a hike.
          </p>
          <h2 class="normalText">
            How will i ask for help?
          </h2>
          <p class="lightText">
            In foundations I will reach out via discord if I am struggling with
            course content. A message which is descriptive of the problem that I
            am facing with an attached photo of the problem. Either posted
            directly to my facilitator, foundations-helpdesk or my homegroup.
          </p>
          <h2 class="subtitle">
            What do i expect from the facilitation team?
          </h2>
          <p class="normalText">
            To be a respectful and helpful guiding hand to assist with anything I
          dont understand or have trouble with. To point me in the right
          direction, not lead me the whole way.
          </p>  
          <h2 class="subtitle">
            Do i have any conficting scheduling information?
          </h2>
          <p class="normalText">
            I have basketball every Wednesday night, but during the tailend of
            bootcamp I already discussed the fact that I might miss a couple of
            games during that time

          <p class="normalText">
            This remains the same as my foundations goal. I am hoping to be able to gain work experience as a junior developer in New Zealand for 18 months - 2 years then move back to England to work. With the same focus on back-end development rather than front-end.

          <p class="lightText">I think my perspective on my ability to learn fast is the same.</p>
          <li class="normalText">Communication</li>
            <p class="lightText">I think my communication in the past has been good but in the past 3 weeks I haven't been on my game. I think this has actually turned into a weakness I would like to work on.</p>
          <li class="normalText">Enthusiastic</li>
          <p class="lightText">This remains the same. I still love learning and still love the course.</p>

            Weaknesses
          </h3>
          <p class="normalText">
            My understanding of my weaknesses has only deepened over the last few weaks and I am hoping to work on my self throughout bootcamp as I want to change.

            What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
          </h2>
          <li class="normalText">Working with others</li>
          <p class="lightText">I often forget or avoid leaning with others. In the past I found it too distracting but now it is a bad habit.</p>
          <li class="normalText">Communication</li>
          <p class="lightText">
            As I mentioned in my strengths section. My communication with peers and facilitators alike has been subpar for me in general.

          <h2 class="subtitle">
            What human skills would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?

          <li class="normalText">Become more mature</li>
          <p class="lightText">
            I want to become more mature in how I deal with bad situations.
          </p>
          <li class="normalText">Asking for help</li>
          <p class="lightText">
            I have a habit of trying to fix everything myself and not asking for help. I want to force myself to be more open to getting help.
          </p>
          <h2 class="subtitle">
            What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
          </h2>
          <p class="normalText">
            I want them to push me so that I develop better communication techniques and hold me accountable for bad situations I put myself in.

          <h2 class="subtitle">
            What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?
          </h2>
          <p class="normalText">
            I know I am going to find it hard to balance everything both technical and human skills wise. I have a whiteboard, calanders and to-do lists set up for managing technical workload. Human skills us something that I am going to push myself with. Reaching out to peers and facilitator is something I am going to work on.
