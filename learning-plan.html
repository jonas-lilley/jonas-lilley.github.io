            What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
          </h2>
          <li class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light my-2">
            Before I anwser this question I think it would be helpful to define
          what a long term goal is for me. It exists 5 years in the future and
          encapsualtes my ideal life, not just carrer. With the ongoing
          development of ai and its inevivitable impact on how society opperates
          I am aiming to be in a position to take advantage of its forward
          directory before the ship sails for good.
          </li>
          <li class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light">
            After completing the devacademy course and getting experience of
          working as a junior fullstack developer I would like to transition to
          working primairily on backend development. Then from there, evaluate
          an area of backend development that I overlaps with my intrests and
          has some scarcity. Grow my proficiency in python and other backend
          languages then try to transition into an AI/ML role.

            Strengths
          </h3>
          <li class="is-size-7">Fast learner
          </li>
          <p class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light">Fortunately my adhd gives me some super powers when it comes to being
            able to process infomation really fast and developing my own systems
            to retain information quickly.
          </p>
          <li class="is-size-7">Communication
          </li>
            <p class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light">I always try best to treat those around me the way I want to be
              treated. This gives me an honest and friendly communication style.
            </p>
          <li class="is-size-7">Enthusiastic
          </li>
          <p class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light"> I love learning and the rush of a subject or concept finally clicking/
            understanding growing. This enthusiasism has created a hard work
            ethic.
          </p>
          <h3 class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-medium my-2">
            Weaknesses
          </h3>
          <li class="is-size-7">
            Fear of faliure
          </li>
          <p class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light">
            I sometimes find it hard to start a project even if I really want to
            do it because I am scared I am not going to live up to my own
            expectations.
          </p>
          <li class="is-size-7">
            Prideful
          </li>
          <p class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light">
            I have a bad habit of taking to long to ask for help and trying to
            solve all my problems by myself. Thinking that I need to shoulder all
            of my burdens on my own.
          </p>
          <li class="is-size-7">
            Dishonest
          </li>
          <p class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light">
            I am never dishonest with others but sometimes I can be dishonest with myself. This leads to giving myself a false sense of security and deluding myself on how things are going.
          </p>
          <h2 class="is-size-6 has-text-weight-medium my-2">
            What skills do I want to develop at dev?
          </h2>
          <li class="is-size-7">To fail better</li>
          <p class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light">Allowing myself to fail more instead of protecting my ego</p>
          <li class="is-size-7">To connect better</li>
          <p class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light">
            Make a more active effort to build genuine connection
            with my peers.
          </p>
          <h2 class="is-size-6 has-text-weight-medium my-2">
            How will I manage my workload?
          </h2>
          <li class="is-size-7">Non-negtionables</li>
          <p class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light">
            Currently I have a peronal self-imposed Non-negotionables routine of
            running and gym workouts. This helps me manage my anxieties and
            providies me with a space to see my problems from a different place.</p>
          <li class="is-size-7">Schuduling systems</li>
          <p class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light">  
            I have: a daily journal, a daily planning sheet, a whiteboard and a
            phyical calender. All of these tools I use to schudule time to work on
            specific things in advance so I don't have to think about what i am
            doing at what time.</p>
          <li class="is-size-7">Planning</li>
          <p class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light"> 
           Every night I review what I have planned for next day and either
          leave it or change it depending on how the day went. I also have
          Sunday Morning as my time during the week to lay the planning ground
          work.
          </p>
          <h2 class="is-size-6 has-text-weight-medium my-2">What support do I have?
          </h2>
          <li class="is-size-7">Famiy</li>
          <p class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light">
            I have my parents to rely on for emotional support if I feel
            overwhelmed.
          </p>
          <li class="is-size-7">Friends</li>
          <p class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light">
            I have a close group of friends that I make to time
            to catch up with every week; whether its going for a beer or going for
            a hike.
          </p>
          <h2 class="is-size-6 has-text-weight-medium my-2">
            How will i ask for help?
          </h2>
          <p class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light">
            In foundations I will reach out via discord if I am struggling with
            course content. A message which is descriptive of the problem that I
            am facing with an attached photo of the problem. Either posted
            directly to my facilitator, foundations-helpdesk or my homegroup.
          </p>
          <h2 class="is-size-6 has-text-weight-medium my-2">
            What do i expect from the facilitation team?
          </h2>
          <p class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light">
            To be a respectful and helpful guiding hand to assist with anything I
          dont understand or have trouble with. To point me in the right
          direction, not lead me the whole way.
          </p>  
          <h2 class="is-size-6 has-text-weight-medium my-2">
            Do i have any conficting scheduling information?
          </h2>
          <p class="block is-size-7 has-text-weight-light">
            I have basketball every Wednesday night, but during the tailend of
            bootcamp I already discussed the fact that I might miss a couple of
            games during that time

          <p class="is-size-7 my-2">
            This remains the same as my foundations goal. I am hoping to be able to gain work experience as a junior developer in New Zealand for 18 months - 2 years then move back to England to work. With the same focus on back-end development rather than front-end.

          <li class="is-size-7">Communication</li>
            <p class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light">I think my communication in the past has been good but in the past 3 weeks I haven't been on my game. I think this has actually turned into a weakness I would like to work on.</p>
          <li class="is-size-7">Enthusiastic</li>
          <p class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light">This remains the same. I still love learning and still love the course.</p>

          <p class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light">
            My understanding of my weaknesses has only deepened over the last few weaks and I am hoping to work on my self throughout bootcamp as I want to change.

            What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?

          <li class="is-size-7">Working with others</li>
          <p class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light">I often forget or avoid leaning with others. In the past I found it too distracting but now it is a bad habit.</p>
          <li class="is-size-7">Communication</li>
          <p class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light">
            As I mentioned in my strengths section. My communication with peers and facilitators alike has been subpar for me in general.

            What human skills would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?

          <li class="is-size-7">Become more mature</li>
          <p class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light">
            I want to become more mature in how I deal with bad situations.
          </p>
          <li class="is-size-7">Asking for help</li>
          <p class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light">
            I have a habit of trying to fix everything myself and not asking for help. I want to force myself to be more open to getting help.

          <p class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light">
            I want them to push me so that I develop better communication techniques and hold me accountable for bad situations I put myself in.

          <p class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-light">
            I know I am going to find it hard to balance everything both technical and human skills wise. I have a whiteboard, calanders and to-do lists set up for managing technical workload. Human skills us something that I am going to push myself with. Reaching out to peers and facilitator is something I am going to work on.
