            What suprised me?

          <p class="normalText">
            That praise can have negative effects on people.If someone alrerady beleives they're smart then they don't have an incentive to grow from something. I think knowing this has made me more mindful about how I talk to people in way which is still positive but doesn't hinder growth.
