          <li class="is-size-7">See challenges as opportunities to grow</li>
          <li class="is-size-7">Embrace mistakes as part of the learning process</li>
          <li class="is-size-7">Persist in the face of setbacks</li>
          <li class="is-size-7">Believe effort leads to mastery</li>

            What suprised me?
          </h2>
          <p class="is-size-7">
            That praise can have negative effects on people.If someone alrerady beleives they're smart then they don't have an incentive to grow from something. I think knowing this has made me more mindful about how I talk to people in way which is still positive but doesn't hinder growth.

          </h2>
          <li class="is-size-7">Always viewing my faliures as an oppurtinty to bounce back from rather than be discouraged</li>
          <li class="is-size-7">Track and document my progress so I can see my improvements or notice bad habits creeping back</li>
          <li class="is-size-7">Trying new approaches to challenges rather than relying on mechanisms that have worked in the past</li>
