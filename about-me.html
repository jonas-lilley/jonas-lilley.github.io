            Always loved sports. I was in the national talent program for both basketball and swimming growing up. I was also pretty good at rowing and volley ball. Last year I ran the gazely half marathon, got 49th in 20-30 year old males which was pretty cool.

            Every since the first covid lock-down I have been pretty into reading and watching anime.

            I always have my headphones in and I always find time during the year to go to music festivals or gigs on the weekend.
