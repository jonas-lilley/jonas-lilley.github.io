            Realtionship between the languages
          </h2>
          <li class="normalText">
            Think of the three languages as tradesmen. HTML is the carpentor, it knows
          how to build the walls and other foundational structures for a house. 
          </li>
          <li class="normalText">
            CSS is the plasterer, they handle making sure the walls built by the carpentor
            (HTML) look nice ready for someone to move in. 
          </li>
          <li class="normalText">
            Javascript is the electricianm they handle the wiring to make sure your house has electricty
            to run your applicances/heating. 
          </li>
          <li class="normalText">
            They all work in unison to build and
            house, and they all understand each others jobs. So much so that you can
            use HTML for CSS work in the same way a carpentor could do the plastering
            but it might be harder. You also run the risk of it not turning out as
            well, so it is best to use the language in its preferred niche.

            Control flow and loops
          </h2>
          <li class="normalText">
            Everyday we ask ourselves questions. For example you might think to
            yourself when you wake up in the morning; "Am I hungry?". 
          </li>
          <li class="normalText">
            Then if you awnser that question with a "Yes I am hungry", you might go to the kitchen
            and ask yourself another question like "What should I eat for breakfast?".
            Or if you awnser it as "No I'm not", you won't go the kitchen and make
            some breakfast. 
          </li>
          <li class="normalText">
            What happends after I ask myself a question changes
            depending on the awnser and depending on that awnser the next question I
            ask or lack of question also changes. But I wouldn't
          </li>
          <li class="normalText">
            In coding this is refereed to as 'control flow', a specific order of questions that change
            based on the awnser.

              Arrays
            </h2>
            <li class="normalText">
              Think of arrays as a shopping list. The shopping list reads: 1. Milk, 2.
              Eggs, 3. Bananas, 4. Shaving cream. 'Milk' in context of this list would
              be '1'. An array has the form of a list and items stored in that list can
              be called using the number they are listed as.

              <li class="normalText">
                Think of objects as a shopping trolley. If all of your groceries were in a
        trolley and 'Milk' would just be 'Milk' it wouldn't be '1'. An object is
        something that values/strings/etc are kept within and are not ordered in a
        specific way.

                Fuctions are like good habits, they help replicate good outcomes without
    needing to think about it. Like making your bed as soon as you wake up. If
    that had to be consious effort everytime that would be a pain, but if its
    a habit you do every day then it is easy peasy.
