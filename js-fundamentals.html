            Realtionship between the languages

          <div class="block is-size-7">
            Think of the three languages as tradesmen. HTML is the carpentor, it knows
          how to build the walls and other foundational structures for a house. 
          </div>
          <div class="block is-size-7">CSS is the plasterer, they handle making sure the walls built by the carpentor
            (HTML) look nice ready for someone to move in. 
          </div>
          <div class="block is-size-7">Javascript is the electricianm they handle the wiring to make sure your house has electricty
            to run your applicances/heating.

          <div class="block is-size-7">
            They all work in unison to build and
            house, and they all understand each others jobs. So much so that you can
            use HTML for CSS work in the same way a carpentor could do the plastering
            but it might be harder. You also run the risk of it not turning out as
            well, so it is best to use the language in its preferred niche.

          Then if you awnser that question with a "Yes I am hungry", you might go to the kitchen

      What is DOM?
    </div>
  <div class="block is-size-7">
    DOM is like a calander. It is a tool that helps us navigate and interact
    with the world. Is the present time really April 15th 10:12am? No, but
    that structures helps me plan my days. In the same way DOM is not an
    original document, it is a tool to help navigate a document through the
    lens of a webrowers rather than the document itself.

    Difference between arrays and objects
  </div>
  <div class="block is-size-7">
    <h1 class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-semibold">Arrays</h1>
      <p>
        Think of arrays as a shopping list. The shopping list reads: 1. Milk, 2.
        Eggs, 3. Bananas, 4. Shaving cream. 'Milk' in context of this list would
        be '1'. An array has the form of a list and items stored in that list can
        be called using the number they are listed as.
      </p>
  </div>
      <div class="block is-size-7">
      <h1 class="is-size-7 has-text-weight-semibold">Objects</h1> 
    <p>
      Think of objects as a shopping trolley. If all of your groceries were in a
      trolley and 'Milk' would just be 'Milk' it wouldn't be '1'. An object is
      something that values/strings/etc are kept within and are not ordered in a
      specific way.

      What are Functions?
  </div>
  <div class="block is-size-7">   
    Fuctions are like good habits, they help replicate good outcomes without
    needing to think about it. Like making your bed as soon as you wake up. If
    that had to be consious effort everytime that would be a pain, but if its
    a habit you do every day then it is easy peasy.
