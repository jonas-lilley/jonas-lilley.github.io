            Overview
          </h2>
          <p class="normalText">
            Both are tags that help target page elements and are fundamental building
          blocks for: css, html and javascript.
          </p>
          <h2 class="subtitle">
            Difference
          </h2>
          <p class="normalText">
            The main difference between both of them is that ids are unique and
      classes are not.
          </p>
          <h2 class="subtitle">
            Classes
          </h2>
          <li class="normalText">
            You can use the same class on multiple elements and you can use multiple
      elements on the same classes.
          </li>
          <li class="normalText">
            Classes cam be used by multiple elements on the same page and
            multiple classes can be used by a single element on the same page, an
            example of best practices is with styling or any other broad targeting
            tasks. Instead of needing to make a new Id for every element you want to
            target you can use classes to speed up the process. Its resusability is it
            strength.
          </li>
          <h2 class="subtitle">
            IDs
          </h2>
          <li class="normalText">
            You can use one ID for each element and each page can only have that one
      element with that Id once.
          </li>
          <li class="normalText">
            Id's are unique to the element it is applied to, an example of its
      best practice is with '#' value or any other specific targeting. By using
      the '#' in a URL, a browser will locate the specfic element with that
      exact '#' value and automatically scroll. It's uniqueness is its strength.
          </li>
          <h2 class="subtitle">
            Best ways to use both
          </h2>
          <li class="normalText">
            Specficity Weight is the rule that css uses when deciding what declaration
            to use. Typically the last declaration found when reading the code from
            top to bottom, also known as 'heirachichy', is what will be used if the
            specficity weight is equal. If however the specficity weight is not equal
            then the more specfic declartion will be used not matter what declartion
            was last found.
          </li>
          <li class="normalText">
            An analogy I found useful for Classes and Ids is serial codes and
      barcodes. A barcode for an iphone product will read the same price at a
      checkout, but both phones have a serial number specfically created for
      itself.
