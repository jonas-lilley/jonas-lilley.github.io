            An ethical decision
          </h2>
          <p class="normalText">
            When I was 19 I moved into a flat with my friends as I started going to
          universtiy for architecture. At first it was great and we all got along
          very well, however this didn't last. Turns out being friends before hand
          doesn't mean that you'll make good flat mates.
          </p>
          <div class="block"></div>
          <p class="normalText">
          We all argued with each 
          other all the time and I was struggling to adjust to university life and
          the challenges I was facing at home. Two of my flatamtes were a couple and
          they broke up. This is when I moved home for a week and spoke to my
          parents as well as outside friends for there perspective.

            After
            diliberating my own feelings I came to a descion to move out of the flat
            because it was the right move for me and my goals. It was a hard
            convosation and some feelings were hrut. At the end of it though everyone
            agreed that it was the best descion to all move out and go our seperate
            ways. I reflect on this descion rarely as I still beleive it was the right
            idea for me and everyone else. The situations before that though could've
            been different if it was me today, but you can't change the past only
            learn and move forward.

           Influences
          </h2>
          <p class="normalText">
            I grew up in England without any extended family. It was just me, my
      sister and my parents. A few times we would have family travel from New
      Zealand visit but that didn't happen often. So my family is very close
      because we were all we had.

            I believe this has instilled a value of
      keeping a smaller circle, but you give and get a lot of love and support
      from that circle. Quality over quainty perhaps. 
          </p>
          <div class="block"></div>
          <p class="normalText">
            I also grew up with
            parents and a community that treated me with empathy, and thats a
            privilage I won't ever forget. So I try to treat anyone, even strangers
            with that same empathy and understanding.

                I have gotten hit with the A.D.H.D stick pretty hard. This causes me to
                have: a hard time starting and finishing boring or tedious tasks , paying
                attention to people, an inflamed reaction to positive or negative events
                and thinking long term.

                They all affect my learning jounrey negatively and
                on paper its not fair. However that is not an excuse for me to give up. I
                have developed systems and habits to work around and with these
                limitations. For the bad habits I haven't brocken just yet, I just have to
                keep trying. You only fail when you give up.

                    While working as a landscaper the projects I worked on were on big
                    commerical sites. We worked to a deadline and this specific instances
                    happened on a friday. By the end of the day we needed to have finished
                    moving the remaining soil into the gardens because in the weekend
                    potential buyers were coming to view the properties.

                    The guy I was working
                    with was around the same age and we got along fine. It was only us two
                    left on site and at the rate we were collectively working we were not
                    going to make the deadline. So I told him that we needed to hurry up .

                    He
                    did not take this well and got mad that I was telling what to do, arguing
                    that I'm not his manager. We did talk it out but only after arguing. If it
                    was the me today in the same situation I wouldn't start off the dialog
                    with a demand but I would start it as a question. So that he doesn't feel
                    like I'm treating him as inferior but as an equal.
