        An ethical decision

      <div class="block is-size-7">
        When I was 19 I moved into a flat with my friends as I started going to
      universtiy for architecture. At first it was great and we all got along
      very well, however this didn't last. Turns out being friends before hand
      doesn't mean that you'll make good flat mates. We all argued with each
      other all the time and I was struggling to adjust to university life and
      the challenges I was facing at home. Two of my flatamtes were a couple and
      they broke up. This is when I moved home for a week and spoke to my
      parents as well as outside friends for there perspective. After
      diliberating my own feelings I came to a descion to move out of the flat
      because it was the right move for me and my goals. It was a hard
      convosation and some feelings were hrut. At the end of it though everyone
      agreed that it was the best descion to all move out and go our seperate
      ways. I reflect on this descion rarely as I still beleive it was the right
      idea for me and everyone else. The situations before that though could've
      been different if it was me today, but you can't change the past only
      learn and move forward.

        My culture and the people around me who have influenced
      my values and identity
      </div>
      <div class="block is-size-7">
        I grew up in England without any extended family. It was just me, my
      sister and my parents. A few times we would have family travel from New
      Zealand visit but that didn't happen often. So my family is very close
      because we were all we had. I believe this has instilled a value of
      keeping a smaller circle, but you give and get a lot of love and support
      from that circle. Quality over quainty perhaps. I also grew up with
      parents and a community that treated me with empathy, and thats a
      privilage I won't ever forget. So I try to treat anyone, even strangers
      with that same empathy and understanding.

        My strengths
      </div>
      <div class="block is-size-7">
        Typically I've found throughout my learning life I see concepts from an
      orthodox perspective. This usually means I pick up on new ideas being
      taught pretty quickly which is a bonus. For better or worse I have got an
      obbessive or passionate personailty who really likes getting good at
      stuff. This causes me to be a hard worker no matter if I want to be one or
      not. Like when I used to work at New World in the produce section; on my
      off days if I found myself in another supermarket I found myself
      internally taking notes from other stores and thinking about differnt ways
      to do my job. I'm still not sure if that was a conscious descion.

        My limitations
        </div>
      <div class="block is-size-7">
        I have gotten hit with the A.D.H.D stick pretty hard. This causes me to
      have: a hard time starting and finishing boring or tedious tasks , paying
      attention to people, an inflamed reaction to positive or negative events
      and thinking long term. They all affect my learning jounrey negatively and
      on paper its not fair. However that is not an excuse for me to give up. I
      have developed systems and habits to work around and with these
      limitations. For the bad habits I haven't brocken just yet, I just have to
      keep trying. You only fail when you give up.

        Working with others in a tough enviroment

      <div class="block is-size-7">
        While working as a landscaper the projects I worked on were on big
      commerical sites. We worked to a deadline and this specific instances
      happened on a friday. By the end of the day we needed to have finished
      moving the remaining soil into the gardens because in the weekend
      potential buyers were coming to view the properties. The guy I was working
      with was around the same age and we got along fine. It was only us two
      left on site and at the rate we were collectively working we were not
      going to make the deadline. So I told him that we needed to hurry up . He
      did not take this well and got mad that I was telling what to do, arguing
      that I'm not his manager. We did talk it out but only after arguing. If it
      was the me today in the same situation I wouldn't start off the dialog
      with a demand but I would start it as a question. So that he doesn't feel
      like I'm treating him as inferior but as an equal.
